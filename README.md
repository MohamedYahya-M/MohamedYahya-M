<h1>Welcome to My GitHub Profile!</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
Hi there! I'm Mohamed Yahya M, a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in DevOps and game development. I have a solid foundation in Linux administration, Docker containerization, cloud computing with AWS, automation using Ansible, continuous integration with Jenkins, and scripting in Python and shell. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging these skills to optimize development and deployment workflows.

<h2>My Work</h2>
I've been actively involved in deploying scalable applications on AWS, managing Dockerized environments, and automating infrastructure provisioning with Ansible. I've also contributed to CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, ensuring seamless integration and delivery of software projects.

<h2>What Iâ€™m Learning</h2>
Currently, I'm delving deeper into Kubernetes for container orchestration and exploring advanced CI/CD practices with Gitops using ArgoCD. I'm also focusing on improving scalability and reliability through infrastructure as code (IaC) principles using Terraform.

<h2>Get in Touch</h2>
I'm passionate about collaborating on DevOps initiatives, discussing best practices, and exploring innovative solutions to complex challenges. Whether you're interested in discussing infrastructure automation, CI/CD strategies, or just want to connect over shared interests, feel free to reach out!
